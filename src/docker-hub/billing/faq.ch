When you downgrade your Pro or Team plan, changes are applied at the end of your billing cycle. For example, if you are currently on a Team plan which is billed on the 8th of every month and you choose to downgrade to a Free Team plan on the 15th, your Team plan will be active until 7th of the following month. You will be transferred to a Free Team plan on the 8th of the following month. Please refer to the next two questions below for instructions on how to downgrade your account.

We recognize there are some circumstances where many pulls will be made that can not be authenticated. For example, cloud CI providers may host builds based on PRs to open source projects. The project owners may be unable to securely use their project’s Docker Hub credentials to authenticate pulls in this scenario, and the scale of these providers would likely trigger the anonymous rate limits. We will unblock these scenarios as necessary and continue iterating on our rate limiting mechanisms to improve the experience, in cooperation with these providers. Please reach out to [support@docker.com](mailto:support@docker.com) if you are encountering issues.
