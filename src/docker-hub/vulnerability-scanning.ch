Docker Hub Vulnerability Scanning enables you to automatically scan Docker images for vulnerabilities using Snyk. This uses the same technology as the [docker scan](../engine/scan/index.md) command.

@x
When you push an image to Docker Hub after enabling vulnerability scanning, Docker Hub automatically scans the image to identify vulnerabilities in your container images. Vulnerability Scanning allows developers and development teams to review the security state of the container images and take actions to fix issues identified during the scan, resulting in more secure deployments. The scan result includes the source of the vulnerability, such as OS packages and libraries, version in which it was introduced, and a recommended fixed version (if available) to remediate the vulnerabilities discovered.

1. Specify an updated base image in the Dockerfile, check your application-level dependencies, rebuild the Docker image and then push the new image to Docker Hub.
2. Rebuild the Docker image, run an update command on the OS packages, and push a newer version of image to Docker Hub.
3. Edit the dockerfile to manually remove or update specific libraries that contain vulnerabilities, rebuild the image, and push the new image to Docker Hub
