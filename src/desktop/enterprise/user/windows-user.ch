Tips on shared drives, permissions, and volume mounts:
@z

@x
- Shared drives are only required for mounting volumes in [Linux containers](#switch-between-windows-and-linux-containers), not for Windows containers. For Linux containers, you need to share the drive where the Dockerfile and volume are located. If you get errors such as `file not found` or `cannot start service` you may need to enable shared drives. See [Volume mounting requires shared drives for Linux containers](/docker-for-windows/troubleshoot#volume-mounting-requires-shared-drives-for-linux-containers).

- If possible, avoid volume mounts from the Windows host, and instead mount on
the Linux VM, or use a [data volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) (named volume) or [data container](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/). There are a number of issues with using host-mounted volumes and network paths
for database files. See [Volume mounts from host paths use a nobrl option to override database locking](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/troubleshoot/#volume-mounts-from-host-paths-use-a-nobrl-option-to-override-database-locking).
