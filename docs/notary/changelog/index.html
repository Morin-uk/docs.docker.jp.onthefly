Delegations allow for easier key management amongst collaborators in a notary trusted collection, and fine-grained permissions on what content each delegate is allowed to modify and sign.
This version also supports managing the snapshot key on notary server, which should be used when enabling delegations on a trusted collection.
Moreover, this version also adds more key management functionality to the notary CLI, and changes the docker-compose development configuration to use the official MariaDB image.</p>
