<p>Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) can utilize Docker Hub to distribute and
sell their Dockerized content. Publish your software through Docker Hub to
experience the following benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Access to Docker’s large and growing customer-base.</strong> Docker has experienced
rapid adoption, and is popular in dev-ops environments. Docker users have
pulled images over twelve billion times and they are increasingly turning to
Docker Hub as the canonical source for high-quality, curated content.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Customers can try or buy your software</strong>, right from your product listing.
Your content is accessible for installation, trial, and purchase from
Docker Hub and the Docker CLI.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Use of Docker licensing support.</strong> Control who has access to your software:
a) logged-in users, b) users who have purchased a license, or c) all Docker
users. We’ll help you manage and control your distribution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>We handle checkout.</strong> You don’t need to set up your own digital
e-commerce site when you sell your content through Docker Hub. Choose
how much you want to charge for your products and we handle the billing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Seamless updates and upgrades for your customers.</strong> We tell your customers
when your content has upgrades or updates available.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Become Docker Certified.</strong> Publisher container images and plugins that meet
the quality, security, and support criteria of the program displays a
“Docker Certified” badge within the Docker Hub (which can be used in
external marketing).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="distribution-models">Distribution models</h2>

<p>Docker Hub welcomes free and open-source content, as well as software sold
directly by publishers. We support the following commercial models:</p>

<h3 id="licensed-content-through-docker-hub-byol-program">Licensed content through Docker Hub BYOL program</h3>

<p>ISVs can use Docker Hub as an entitlement and distribution platform. Using
APIs provided by Docker, ISVs can entitle users and distribute their Dockerized
content to many different audiences:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Existing customers that want their licensed software made available as Docker containers.</li>
  <li>New customers that are only interested in consuming their software as Docker containers.</li>
  <li>Trial or beta customers, where the ISV can distribute feature or time limited software.</li>
</ul>

<p>Docker provides a fulfillment service so that ISVs can programmatically entitle
users, by creating subscriptions to their content in Docker Hub. For more
information, see <a href="/docs.docker.jp.onthefly/docker-hub/publish/byol/">Bring Your Own License (BYOL) products on Hub</a>.</p>

<h3 id="plugins-and-agents">Plugins and agents</h3>

<p>ISVs have the ability to create and distribute <a href="https://hub.docker.com/search?certification_status=certified&amp;q=&amp;type=plugin">plugin images</a> for their customers to integrate with the ISV’s proprietary hardware or cloud infrastructure and Docker Enterprise deployments.</p>
