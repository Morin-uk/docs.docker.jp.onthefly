<h2 id="what-is-bring-your-own-license-byol">What is Bring Your Own License (BYOL)?</h2>

<p>Bring Your Own License (BYOL) allows customers with existing software licenses
to easily migrate to the containerized version of the software that you make
available on Docker Hub.</p>

<p>To see and access the BYOL product listing of an Independent Softare Vendor
(ISV), customers simply subscribe to the product with their Docker ID. We call
this <strong>Ungated BYOL</strong>.</p>

<p>ISVs can use the Docker Hub as an entitlement and distribution platform
for their various audiences, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Existing customers that want their licensed software made available as Docker containers.</li>
  <li>New customers that are only interested in consuming their software as Docker containers.</li>
</ul>
