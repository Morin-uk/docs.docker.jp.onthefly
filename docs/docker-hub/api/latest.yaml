  description: |
    Docker Hub is a service provided by Docker for finding and sharing container images with your team.
    It is the world's largest library and community for container images.
    In addition to the [Docker Hub UI](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/) and [Docker Hub CLI tool](https://github.com/docker/hub-tool#readme) (currently experimental),
    Docker provides an API that allows you to interact with Docker Hub.
    Browse through the Docker Hub API documentation to explore the supported endpoints.

  # Primary objects
  - name: Authentication
    x-displayName: Authentication
    description: |
      Most Docker Hub API endpoints require you to authenticate using your Docker credentials.

      Additionally, similar to the Docker Hub UI features, API endpoint responses may vary depending on your plan (Free, Pro, or Team) and your account's permissions.
      To learn more about the features available in each plan and to upgrade your existing plan, see [Docker Pricing](https://www.docker.com/pricing).
  - name: Images
    x-displayName: Advanced image management
    description: |
      The Advanced Image Management API endpoints allow you to manage Docker images across all repositories.
      For more information, see [Advanced Image Management dashboard](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/image-management/).

      summary: Delete images
      operationId: PostNamespacesDeleteImages
      description: |
        Deletes one or more images within a namespace. This is currently limited to a single repostiory.

        If you attempt to delete images that are marked as active or are currently tagged, the deletion does not happen and it displays the warnings.
        To continue with the deletion, you must ignore these warnings by putting them in the `ignore_warnings` property.

        Deleting a currently tagged image deletes the tag from the repository.

        You cannot ignore errors. It is not possible to directly delete children of multi-arch images.
