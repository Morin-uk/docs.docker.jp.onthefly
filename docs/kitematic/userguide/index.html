<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Kitematic is an open source project built to simplify and streamline using
Docker on a Mac or Windows PC. Kitematic automates the Docker
installation and setup process and provides an intuitive graphical user
interface (GUI) for running Docker containers.  Kitematic integrates with
<a href="/machine/">Docker Machine</a> to provision a VirtualBox VM
and install the Docker Engine locally on your machine.</p>

<p>Once installed, the Kitematic GUI launches and from the home screen you are
presented with curated images that you can run instantly. You can search for any
public images on Docker Hub from Kitematic just by typing in the search bar.
You can use the GUI to create, run and manage your containers just by clicking
on buttons. Kitematic allows you to switch back and forth between the Docker CLI
and the GUI.  Kitematic also automates advanced features such as managing ports
and configuring volumes.  You can use Kitematic to change environment variables,
stream logs, and single click terminal into your Docker container all from the
GUI.</p>

<p>First, if you haven’t yet done so, download and install Kitematic in one of the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Choose <strong>Kitematic</strong> from the Docker Desktop for Mac or Docker Desktop for Windows menu to get started with the Kitematic install.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Download Kitematic directly from the <a href="https://github.com/docker/kitematic/releases/">Kitematic releases page</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Start Kitematic. (On desktop systems, click on the app.)</p>

<h2 id="log-in-with-your-docker-id">Log in with your Docker ID</h2>

<p>Provide your Docker ID and user name and click <strong>LOG IN</strong> or click <strong>Skip for now</strong> to browse Docker Hub as a guest.</p>

<h2 id="container-list">Container list</h2>

<p>Kitematic lists all running and stopped containers on the left side, underneath
the “New Container” link.</p>

<p>The container list includes all containers, even those not started by Kitematic,
giving you a quick over-view of the state of your Docker daemon.</p>

<p>You can click on any container to view its logs (the output of the main container
process), restart, stop or exec <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sh</code> in that container. See
<a href="/docs.docker.jp.onthefly/kitematic/userguide/#working-with-a-container">Working with a container</a> for more details.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-new-container">Creating a new container</h2>

<p>The “New Container” page lets you search for and select from images on the Docker Hub.
When you’ve found the image you want to run, you can click “Create” to pull, create,
and run the container.</p>

<p><img src="/docs.docker.jp.onthefly/kitematic/images/browse-images.png" alt="Nginx create" /></p>

<h2 id="working-with-a-container">Working with a container</h2>

<p>If you select a non-running container, either stopped, or paused, you can
“Restart” or “Stop” the container using the icons. You can also view the entire
main container process’ output logs, and in the Settings section you can make
changes which are used if you “Restart” this container.</p>

<p>By selecting a running container from the left list, you can see some state information
for your container - either a preview of the HTML output for a container that has a web
server, the main container process’ logs, and any container volumes that have been
configured.</p>

<p><img src="/docs.docker.jp.onthefly/kitematic/images/cli-redis-container.png" alt="Redis container in Kitematic" /></p>

<p>The summary page shows different things depending on the image metadata. If
a known “web” port (see below) is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EXPOSED</code>, then Kitematic assumes its a web page,
and shows a preview of the site at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code>. If other ports are exposed, then it
shows a list of those ports, and the Docker daemon IP and port they are mapped
to. If there are any <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VOLUMES</code>, then these are shown. At minimum, the summary
screen shows the main container process’ log output.</p>

<p>The currently detected “web” ports are, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">80</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">8000</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">8080</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3000</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5000</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2368</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">9200</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">8983</code>.</p>

<h3 id="viewing-container-logs">Viewing container logs</h3>

<p>You can view the entire main container process’ log output either by clicking on the “Logs”
preview image, or by clicking on the “Logs” tab.</p>

<p>You can then scroll through the logs from the current running container. Note that
if you make changes to the container settings, then the container is restarted,
so this resets this log view.</p>

<h3 id="starting-a-terminal-in-a-container">Starting a terminal in a container</h3>

<p>The “Terminal” icon at the top of the container summary runs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docker container exec -i -t &lt;your container&gt; sh</code>.
This allows you to make quick changes, or to debug a problem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: Your exec’ed <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sh</code> process does not have the same environment settings
as the main container process and its children.
Get the environment commands for your shell: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docker-machine env default</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="managing-volumes">Managing Volumes</h3>

<p>You can choose to make all of a container’s volumes mapped to directories on
on your Mac by clicking on the folders in the “Edit Files” section of the
container summary screen.</p>

<p>This allows you to manage files in volumes via the Finder.
Kitematic exposes a container’s volume data under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/Documents/Kitematic/&lt;container's name&gt;/</code>.
Quick access to this folder (or directory) is available via the app:</p>

<p><img src="/docs.docker.jp.onthefly/kitematic/images/volumes-dir.png" alt="Accessing the volumes directory" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: When you “Enable all volumes to edit files in Finder”, the Docker
container is stopped, removed and re-created with the new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">volumes</code>
flag.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="changing-volume-directories">Changing Volume Directories</h4>

<p>Let’s say you have an Nginx webserver running via Kitematic (using the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kitematic/hello-world-nginx</code> image on DockerHub). However, you don’t want to
use the default directory created for the website_files volume. Instead, you
already have the HTML, Javascript, and CSS for your website under
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/workspace/website</code>.</p>

<p>Navigate to the “Settings” tab of the container, and go to the “Volumes”. This
screen allows you to set the mappings individually.</p>

<p><img src="/docs.docker.jp.onthefly/kitematic/images/change-folder.png" alt="screen shot 2015-02-28 at 2 48 01 pm" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: When you “Change Folders”, the Docker
container is stopped, removed and re-created with the new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">volumes</code>
flag.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="setting-the-container-name">Setting the container name</h3>

<p>By default, Kitematic sets the container name to the same as the image name (or
with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-&lt;number&gt;</code> if there are more than one.
To simplify administration, or when using container linking or volumes, you may
want to rename it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: When you rename the container it is stopped, removed and
re-created with the new name (due to the default volumes mapping).</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="adding-environment-variables">Adding Environment variables</h3>

<p>Many images use environment variables to let you customize them. The “General”
“Settings” tab allows you to add and modify the environment variables used to
start a container.</p>

<p>The list of environment variables shows any that have been set on the image
metadata - for example, using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ENV</code> instruction in the Dockerfile.</p>

<p>When you “Save” the changed environment variables, the container is
stopped, removed and re-created.</p>

<h3 id="delete-container">Delete container</h3>

<p>On the “General” “Settings” tab, you can delete the container. Clicking “Delete
Container” also stops the container if necessary.</p>

<p>You can also delete a container by clicking the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X</code> icon in the container list.</p>

<p>Kitematic prompts you to confirm that you want to delete.</p>

<h4 id="list-the-exposed-ports-and-how-to-access-them">List the exposed Ports and how to access them</h4>

<p>To see the complete list of exposed ports, go to “Settings” then “Ports”. This
page lists all the container ports exposed, and the IP address and host-only
network port that you can access use to access that container from your macOS
system.</p>

<h2 id="docker-command-line-access">Docker Command-line Access</h2>

<p>You can interact with existing containers in Kitematic or create new containers
via the Docker Command Line Interface (CLI). Any changes you make on the CLI are
directly reflected in Kitematic.</p>

<p>To open a terminal via Kitematic, just press the whale button at the bottom left, as
shown below:</p>

<p><img src="/docs.docker.jp.onthefly/kitematic/images/cli-access-button.png" alt="CLI access button" /></p>

<h3 id="example-creating-a-new-redis-container">Example: Creating a new Redis container</h3>

<p>Start by opening a Docker-CLI ready terminal by clicking the whale button as
described above. Once the terminal opens, enter <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docker run -d -P redis</code>. This
pulls, creates, and runs a new Redis container via the Docker CLI.</p>

<p><img src="/docs.docker.jp.onthefly/kitematic/images/cli-terminal.png" alt="Docker CLI terminal window" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: If you’re creating containers from the command line, use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docker run -d</code>
so that Kitematic can re-create the container when settings are changed via the
Kitematic user interface. Containers started without <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-d</code> fails to restart.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, go back to Kitematic. The Redis container is now visible.</p>

<p><img src="/docs.docker.jp.onthefly/kitematic/images/cli-redis-container.png" alt="Redis container in Kitematic" /></p>
