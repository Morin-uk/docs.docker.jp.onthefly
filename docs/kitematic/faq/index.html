<h3 id="why-does-kitematic-collect-usage-analytics-and-bug-reports">Why does Kitematic collect usage analytics and bug reports?</h3>

<p>Kitematic tracks anonymous errors and analytics to help understand why things go
wrong and to help understand how users are interacting with the app so we can
continuously make it better.</p>

<p>You can opt-out of this anytime via the in-app preferences.</p>

<h4 id="what-we-dont-collect">What we DON’T collect</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Personal information: any information that would allow us to determine a
specific user of Kitematic</li>
  <li>Information or data relating to code, containers, or Docker images opened via
Kitematic.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="what-we-do-collect">What we DO collect</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Anonymous events for actions in the app. We never collect data associated with
events. For example:
    <ul>
      <li>User searched for images (but not what the search query was).</li>
      <li>User created a container (but not which image, the name of the container or
any data involved)</li>
      <li>User opened the preferences pane</li>
      <li>User deleted a container</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Errors names, messages &amp; stack traces (scrubbed for user names)</li>
  <li>Operating System, Kitematic and installed VirtualBox versions</li>
</ul>
