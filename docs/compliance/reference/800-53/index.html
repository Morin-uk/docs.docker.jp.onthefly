<p>This section serves as a quick-reference for NIST Special Publication (SP)
800-53 Revision 4 security controls that are applicable to the latest release of
Docker Enterprise Edition (EE). For generating your own security documentation
using the machine-readable source content of these control mappings, please
refer to our compliance repository at
<a href="https://github.com/docker/compliance">https://github.com/docker/compliance</a>.</p>

<p>The controls have been broken out by family and each control’s origin is mapped
to one of the following:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Control Origination</th>
      <th>Definition</th>
      <th>Example</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Service provider corporate</td>
      <td>A control that originates from agency’s corporate network</td>
      <td>DNS from the corporate network provides address resolution services for the information system and the service offering</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Docker EE system</td>
      <td>A control specific to Docker EE</td>
      <td>Docker EE LDAP configuration</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Service provider hybrid</td>
      <td>A control that makes use of both corporate controls and additional controls specific to Docker EE</td>
      <td>There are scans of the corporate network infrastructure; scans of Docker images via DTR would be included</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Configured by customer</td>
      <td>A control where the Docker EE end-user’s application needs to apply a configuration in order to meet the control requirement</td>
      <td>User profiles, policy/audit configurations, enable/disabling key switches (e.g., enable/disable http or https, etc), entering an IP range specific to the end-user’s organization are configurable by the customer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Provided by customer</td>
      <td>A control where the Docker EE end-user’s application needs to provide additional hardware or software in order to meet the control requirement</td>
      <td>The customer provides a SAML SSO solution to implement two-factor authentication</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Shared</td>
      <td>A control that is managed and implemented partially by the Docker EE system and partially by the Docker EE end-user</td>
      <td>Security awareness training must be conducted by both the Docker EE operators and end-users</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Inherited from pre-existing Provisional Authorization</td>
      <td>A control that is inherited from another CSP system that has already received a Provisional Authorization</td>
      <td>Docker EE inherites PE controls from an IaaS provider</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The following Docker EE system components are referenced by these controls:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Docker EE Engine</li>
  <li>Universal Control Plane (UCP)</li>
  <li>Docker Trusted Registry (DTR)</li>
  <li>Authentication and Authorization Service (eNZi) (embedded within UCP)</li>
  <li>Docker Security Scanning (DSS) (embedded within DTR but only as part of the EE “Advanced” subscription tier)</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, each control is assigned one or more of the following
implementation statuses:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Implementation status</th>
      <th>Definition</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Complete</td>
      <td>The control is fully in place and meets all requirements</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Partial</td>
      <td>The control is only partially in place or does not meet all requirements. A plan for achieving full implementation should be included in the Plan of Action &amp; Milestone documentation</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Planned</td>
      <td>The control is not in place. A plan for achieving full implementation should be included in the Plan of Action &amp; Milestone documentation</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>None</td>
      <td>The control is not applicable within the environment. A description of why the requirement does not apply should be included</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Control narratives that include an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[Assignment: ...]</code> block should be
substituted by your organization’s requirements or by an alternative set of
requirements (for instance FedRAMP baselines).</p>
