<p>The Center for Internet Security (CIS) Docker Community Edition (CE) Benchmark
is a reference document designed to assist system administrators, security and
audit professionals, and other technologists in establishing a secure
configuration baseline for the Docker CE Engine. CIS Benchmarks are developed by

<p>The latest benchmark for Docker CE 17.06 (CIS Benchmark v1.1.0) can be found
<a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/docker/">here</a>. This benchmark is only
applicable to the Docker Community Edition Engine and does not encompass many of
the security capabilities designed to help your organization satisfy crucial
compliance requirements and that which are provided by the complete Docker
Enterprise Edition stack.</p>
