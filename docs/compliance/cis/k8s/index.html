<p>The Center for Internet Security (CIS) Kubernetes Benchmark is a reference
document that can be used by system administrators, security and audit
professionals and other IT roles to establish a secure configuration baseline
for Kubernetes. CIS Benchmarks are developed by an open community of security

<p>The latest benchmark for Kubernetes 1.8 (CIS Benchmark v1.2.0) can be found
<a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes/">here</a>. This benchmark can be
used to harden the Kubernetes components that are made available as part of the
upcoming release of Docker Enterprise Edition (18.01).</p>

<p>Below is a list of tools and resources that can be used to automate the
