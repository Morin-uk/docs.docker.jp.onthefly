<h2 id="image-manifest-version-2-schema-1">Image manifest version 2, schema 1</h2>
<p>With the release of image manifest version 2, schema 2, image manifest version
2, schema 1 has been deprecated. This could lead to compatibility and
vulnerability issues in images that havenâ€™t been updated to image manifest
version 2, schema 2.</p>

<p>This page contains information on how to update from image manifest version 2,
schema 1. However, these instructions will not ensure your new image will run
successfully. There may be several other issues to troubleshoot that are
associated with  the deprecated image manifest that will block your image from
running succesfully. A list of possible methods to help update your image is
also included below.</p>

<h3 id="update-to-image-manifest-version-2-schema-2">Update to image manifest version 2, schema 2</h3>

<p>One way to upgrade an image from image manifest version 2, schema 1 to
schema 2 is to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docker pull</code> the image and then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docker push</code> the image with a
current version of Docker. Doing so will automatically convert the image to use
the latest image manifest specification.</p>

<p>Converting an image to image manifest version 2, schema 2 converts the
manifest format, but does not update the contents within the image. Images
using manifest version 2, schema 1 may contain unpatched vulnerabilities. We
recommend looking for an alternative image or rebuilding it.</p>

<h3 id="update-from-statement">Update FROM statement</h3>

<p>You can rebuild the image by updating the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FROM</code> statement in your
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Dockerfile</code>. If your image manifest is out-of-date, there is a chance the
image pulled from your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FROM</code> statement in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Dockerfile</code> is also
out-of-date. See the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#from">Dockerfile reference</a>
and the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/">Dockerfile best practices guide</a>
for more information on how to update the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FROM</code> statement in your
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Dockerfile</code>.</p>
